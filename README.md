## Project Overview

With this dataset, we are able to see a large amount of information from several different Locations, Genres and Countries.  With this amount of data, we can drill down to help with decision making for future goals or see current and past data sets.

### Analysis
By manipulating the data to what was needed, we produced data spreads for Theater Outcomes by Launch date and by goals as shown below

Here we see that based off the info, 
April to August could be the best time of the year have a successful play.

Here is shown the outcomes of plays based on the goal amount wanted by Plays listed in our Kickstarter workbook.

## Challenges of this Task
I found that creating pivot tables with the correct information required is what I feel I will need the most refreshing on. The data was not terrible to manipulate but was challenging to get into the correct formats. I overcame some of the difficulties by getting on Youtube for examples along with going back through the notes from the Live Lesson videos uploaded by our Instructor Erik
